    <h1>About Blackstone Grill</h1>

    <p>
        Blackstone Grill is a locally owned food truck dedicated to serving fresh,
        flavorful meals to the community. What started as a passion for cooking
        has grown into a mobile dining experience that brings quality food to
        neighborhoods, events, and gatherings.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our mission is to provide great-tasting food made with care and consistency.
        We believe in using quality ingredients, friendly service, and creating
        a welcoming experience for every customer.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to our regular menu, we proudly feature Claudia’s Cookies,
        a homemade dessert option baked fresh and enjoyed by customers of all ages.
